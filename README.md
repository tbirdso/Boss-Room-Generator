# ECE 4420 Project #2: Procedural Room Generator

A fuzzy rules-based procedural room generator is developed in FuzzyCLIPS to deterministically render 
tile maps for the "Project Corridor" virtual reality project. Room rendering logic is
encoded into fuzzy membership functions and used to assign tiles in a particular "boss room"
as fuzzy members of three available tile variants. Each tile is then collapsed into one of
three variants in order to produce a crisp tile map.

This project was proposed, developed, and submitted in conjunction with the 
Clemson University ECE 4420 "Knowledge Engineering" technical elective course
and the Project Corridor student project. The final project report is available in the ECE_4420_Takehome_2.pdf file.
